# Image Processing with Python
Image class 
Good Practices in Research Software Development
During 'Image Processing with Python' workshops, researchers learn image processing skills to facilitate open and reproducible research with images. Topics will include basics of image processing like thresholding, blurring, bitwise operations and histograms. Advanced topics of connected components analysis and transformations will be covered as well.

This lesson is based on the [Carpentries lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/setup/).
