# Image Processing with Python

During 'Image Processing with Python' workshops, researchers will learn image processing skills to facilitate open and reproducible research with images. Topics will include basics of image processing like thresholding, blurring, bitwise operations and histograms. Intermediate topics of connected components analysis and transformations will be covered as well.

This lesson is based on the [Carpentries lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/).

The sylabus changes depending whether the course is online or in person.

The course was also be taught [internally](internal_workshop.md).

## Environment:
To work with the correct packages:
Install all Python packages required, using conda and the
    `environment.yml` file.

  * The command for Windows/Anaconda users will be:
     `conda env create -f environment.yml`

  You can find additional instructions in our [setup](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/image-processing/blob/main/setup.md)

PLEASE NOTE: Building this environment will potentially take a lot of time, especially if your memory is low.
If it takes too long (up to 30 minutes), don't worry. If you lack patience, install ```mamba``` in your base environment, and use it 
as a drop in substitute for conda.
