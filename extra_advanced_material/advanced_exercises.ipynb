For example if we have a body CT , and we want to build an algorithm that looks at only the bony structures we may want to perform a segmentation  to segment only the bones. In this case you might guess the idea behind segmentation could very simple, as the bones will be of very different pixel intensity values than surrounding tissue. But in other cases things may not be so simple. There are many different algorithms used for segmentation. This course will touch on the edge of a few, but one that is popular, and not covered is watershedding.\n",
