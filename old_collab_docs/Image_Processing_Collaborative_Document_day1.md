Name/ Organization


## 💻👩‍💼🔬👨‍🔬🧑‍🔬🚀🔧 Mini-survey
For all questions, please put your name as well

### ❓💁 What type of images do you work on? What format(s) are these usually in?
- (example:) Dani / microscopy images / tif, nd2

### ❓💁 What methods or software do you currently use to analyze your images? What are the advantages and/or pitfalls of these methods?
- (example:) Dani / ImageJ / It has a nice GUI and decent built-in macro language and many pre-existing libraries for simple and medium-complexity analyses, but is buggy, slow and ultimately runs short when doing high complexity analysis.

* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
