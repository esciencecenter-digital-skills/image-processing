### Requirements

- An integrated development environment (IDE), we recommend [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Python version 3.8 or higher, we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or
  [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
- Git. If you're on Windows, follow these instructions: [Git for Windows](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell).


To follow along with the workshop, you need to prepare an environment. Clone the workshop repository
that we prepared:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/image-processing.git
cd image-processing

```

You may prepare the environment in `conda`.

#### Conda (recommended)
For most users we recommend that you use `conda` to install the requirements for the workshop.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate image_libraries
```

In any doubt, please contact us before the workshop.
